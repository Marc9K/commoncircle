- we're working on the UI mock so do not implement functionality yet
- for each view/components create a Storybook
- do NOT add sample/mock data to the views themselves, have it passed down to them as args
- absolutely NO mock data outside of storybook files
- use my custom <Variable> and <Visible> when adjusting UI do screen size
  -- when using those if there is a need to rearrenge components - declare meaningful chunks into functions outside the main for easier rearrenge
- if creating info cards - put them as a separate component
- do NOT try to simulate API call or any functionality; only navigation to other pages or variable change
- do NOT add comments to announce sections
- keep all the data in separate files
- use Flat Color Icons
